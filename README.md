# The Odin Project
This is a general umbrella for a bunch of repositories I'm working on for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). There's little else to say from there except to list the existing projects I've decided to place here in chronological order:

 - [Etch-a-Sketch](https://github.com/NeoPlato/odin-etch-a-sketch)
 - [Calculator](https://github.com/NeoPlato/odin-calculator)
 - [Signup Form](https://github.com/NeoPlato/odin-signup-form)
 - [Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/NeoPlato/odin-admin-dashboard)
 - [Library](https://github.com/NeoPlato/odin-library)
 - [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/NeoPlato/odin-tic-tac-toe)

## Notes

 1. The repositories are of varying quality and are best judged individually.
 2. I'll probably update this as well as the content of the repositories themselves.
 3. Unlike the individual repositories, this one will be hosted on my silly-sounding domain (technically subdomain because order and precision) [odin.neoplato.io](https://odin.neoplato.io). Yes, this is my thing now. I don't know if I can do SEO enough to beat the Stanford University articles on neoplatonism.
